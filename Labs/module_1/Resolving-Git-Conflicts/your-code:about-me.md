I am Sandrine ROSAMONT. I am from Paris. Currently I am Business controller in Supply Chain. As a controller I work a bit with data.
I was looking for a training to improve my data analytics skills and switch to the tech area and I discover the  Vinted partnership with Ironhack via an advertisement on Vinted.
I expect to learn how to use Python, how to present my analyses in a professional and structured way and how to handle big volumes of data.
I will seek employment  first in the tech industry but I will also have a look to the retail industry as I have some experience in this industry. 
I am would like to become a data scientist in the coming years.
